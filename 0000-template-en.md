- The investment required to implement this feature, including the complexity of the code, the increase in code size, and the manpower required to implement the feature.
- Whether this feature does not need to be provided by hapjs and developers using hapjs can even implement it better at the application layer.
- The impact on the established development habits of hapjs.
- The impact on the published versions and existing features, as well as the cost of user migration.
- The impact on other RFC proposals that have not yet been implemented.

## Alternative Choices
